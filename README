*******************************
* Create Boot Image for AC100 *
*******************************

This little perl script is used to create an all in one
boot image, which is supposed to be loaded by tegrarcm[1]
to the ac100 (or any other tegra device supported by tegrarcm).

The purpose is that you don't need to flash an installer, thus
avoiding proprietary applications like nvflash and fastboot. It
is meant to include some installer in the initrd which takes care
of partitioning, flashing (just dd to mmcblk*) and installing.

The script takes 6 parameters:

    - uboot image
    - kernel image
    - initrd image
    - device tree (compiled, dtb)
    - uboot script
    - output file

The uboot script is a text file with commands to be executed
during start. It can contain the following variables:
    @KERNEL, @INITRD, @FDT
which are replaced by the corresponding load address, .e.g.

"bootz @KERNEL @INITRD @FDT" is replaced by
"bootz <kernel address> <initrd address> <fdt address>"

The uboot image is patched so the unmodified uboot tree from e.g.
git://git.denx.de/u-boot-tegra.git can be used without modifications.
This is done by replacing the standard bootcmd string with
"source <script address>", so the script is executed instead. This
gives you all kinds of freedom.

The resulting image can be loaded via tegrarcm[1] with e.g.

tegrarcm --bct paz00.bct --bootloader bootimage.bin --loadaddr 0x108000

where paz00.bct is the bct of your device[2] and bootimage.bin is the
file created by this script.
